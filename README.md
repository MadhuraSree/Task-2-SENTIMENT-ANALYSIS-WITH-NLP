Task 2 ‚Äì Sentiment Analysis using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression

Internship Project - Machine Learning (CodTech)

## About the Project
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It involves converting text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization and training a Logistic Regression model to classify the reviews as positive or negative.
The project is developed as part of the Machine Learning Internship by CodTech IT Solutions and demonstrates the use of NLP in real-world text classification problems.

## Dataset Description
Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is a collection of customer or user-generated reviews or messages, each labeled with a sentiment category. It is used to train and evaluate a binary sentiment analysis model.
üìÅ Dataset Name:
train.csv
Sentiment or category ‚Äî Target label (Positive/Negative/Neutral)
Classes Used:
1 ‚Äî Positive
0 ‚Äî Negative
(Neutral rows are removed if present)

## Key features
Load the Dataset ‚Äì A CSV file containing reviews and sentiment labels

Text Preprocessing ‚Äì Remove special characters, convert to lowercase, and clean noise

Feature Extraction ‚Äì Apply TF-IDF to extract relevant words and phrases

Model Training ‚Äì Use Logistic Regression or LinearSVC for classification

Evaluation ‚Äì Check accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Custom Predictions ‚Äì Test model on new review inputs

## Libraries Used

pandas, re ‚Äì For data cleaning

sklearn ‚Äì For model training, evaluation, and TF-IDF

matplotlib, seaborn ‚Äì For visualizing confusion matrix and results
